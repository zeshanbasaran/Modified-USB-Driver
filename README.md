# Modified-USB-Driver

## Objective
To reverse engineer the Linux USB driver usb-storage by identifying system calls, finding the implementation of these calls, and understanding how their implementation works. The driver will be modified to implement automatic encryption of files added to a USB flash drive and introduce user authentication for accessing the files.
